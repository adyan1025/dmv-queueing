# Balancing Optimal Efficiency and Equitable Wait Times in Multi-Server Queues with Reinforced Learning Model
## ⚠️ On-going project

This paper presents a simulation model of a DMV service system designed to balance fairness and operational efficiency. Customers arrive with tasks of varying base complexities and a chance of unexpected complications that increase service time. Workers differ in skill and specialization, with specialists efficiently handling complex cases. Customers accumulate fairness credits based on waiting time and skipped service to ensure equitable treatment. The model assigns customers to workers using a priority score balancing fairness and efficiency, where the relative importance of each factor can be learned via reinforcement learning. We demonstrate how this approach improves wait times and fairness compared to fixed queue policies.
